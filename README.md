## Data Set
From the US Census Bureau and pulled from Google Cloud, I present the Top Ten Male Names In Texas. Why so specific? Because anything less was too big, either in size (Github wouldn't let me do everyone) or in quantity (making names for every option in html would have been awful). 

## The Code
Code uses primarily HTML and JS with the D3 library we were taught. The interation between these are pretty seemless. Only slowdown is that I pull the entire table down to put a new one up so it looks cleaner (and code simmpler). Only area of improvement I can think of (other than menu things)

## Findings
It's interesting to see the trends of names. Michael and Christopher are actually really interesting due to having no popularity at all for the first half of the century, to later having the most (Christopher) for no real reason that I can think of.

## The Karate Kid
Daniel, not only being a popular name, spiked in this year (and later drops of due to population decline in the US as a whole). I found some real humor in this, mostly because it's neat to see how our culture affects our decisions.

## Conclusion
I've recently been working an internship where Javascript is the norm, so I came into this a little better than the first time around. I am sorry for not being able to get this done sooner and I hope that everything looks alright. Had a hard time figuring out the D3 library and debugging such things, since I'm never really sure what went wrong. But things turned out pretty good in the end.
